This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves a mismatch between the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) version used by the Expo project and the version expected or supported by the Android build tools.  This can manifest in various cryptic error messages during the build process.  For example, you might see errors related to `transformClassesWithDexBuilderForDebug`,  missing dependencies, or issues with the `build.gradle` files.  The core problem is a version incompatibility, causing the build system to fail.
