The solution involves updating the AGP version in your `android/build.gradle` files to match the expected version.  The specific version you should use might depend on your Expo SDK version and other project dependencies.  You may need to consult Expo's documentation or community forums to determine the correct version. It's also a good practice to update other Gradle dependencies for consistency.

Here's a simplified example of how to update the AGP version (adjust the version number according to your needs):

```gradle
// In android/build.gradle (Project level)
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        classpath("com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.4") // Update this line
    }
}

// In android/app/build.gradle (Module level)
android {
    compileSdkVersion 33 // Adjust to your compileSdk
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "your.app.id"
    }
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```

After making these changes, clean and rebuild the project using `expo prebuild` and `expo run:android`.
